Solution:

1. Connect to the challenge infrastructure

2. Fuzzing the application, it appears that whenever we upload a zip file, it is automatically extracted
   according to the logs. We also appear to be able to browse the server.

3. Leveraging Zip Slip (https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability) we may be able to write files
   to arbitrary locations on the system.

4. Now that we know the flag is located at /app/flag.txt we can craft a custom .cshtml page to read the
   the contents

   	a. Flag.cshtml

5. Create our zip payload with the provided Python script, courtesy of our friendly AI

	a. create.py

6. Upload the zip file to the server using any Name and ID

7. Once the payload has been written to disk, navigate to the CSHTML page to retrieve the flag
