** John was a monster for creating this challenge, that is all I have to say about that **

1. The first thing I did was analyze this code with Snyk.io I was immediately informed of a RCE, SQLi, and a Deseralization error.

2. After identifying the SQL injection, we were able to craft the following payload:

	a. \;INSERT/**/INTO/**/activesessions/**/(sessionid,/**/username,/**/timestamp)/**/values/**/(\abc\,/**/\admin\,/**/\123\);/**/--

3. I didn't get to finish this write-up, please see others linked in the main part of the repo.
