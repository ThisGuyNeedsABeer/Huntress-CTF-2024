Help Me IT!! My USB was stolen! I was headed into town for some work and stopped by a client's coffee shop to get work done. Everything was fine; I was working and drinking coffee. I got up to use the restroom; when I returned, I saw that my computer had been tampered with! All my work was closed out, and my flash drive with my projects was gone! I can't lose this; there was very important work on it! I thought the security tools you put in place would stop something like this!!
When I was looking at the desktop, I noticed three new files that were not there before. I opened one to see if they were my files, but they are a jumbled mess. I can't make any sense of it. I think it is that "ran somewhere" that your team keeps warning us about. I still don't know what it is, but please reverse this and get my USB back. I can't believe this happened!
I am attaching those files so you can fix them.
