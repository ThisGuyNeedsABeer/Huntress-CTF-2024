5. Now that we have our modified values, let's kill this spider

6. Attacking the spider, moves us onto the Ogre who spawns with 1/50 health, we have the right addresses
   for enemy healthy identified. Attack the Orgre and move on to the next opponent

7. We have slayn the Ogre, and are met with Gorthmog, Destroy of Worlds who seemingly has "999999999"
   health points.
