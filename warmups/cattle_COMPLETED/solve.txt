Description:
I know it's an esoteric challenge for a Capture the Flag, but could you herd these cows for me?

Download the file(s) below.
Attachments: cattle

1. Download the file cattle and inspect it with file

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/CTF/huntress2024/warmups/cattle]
└─$ file cattle                 
cattle: ASCII text

2. Since it's ASCII text, lets open with our text editor, Sublime Text, in typical John Hammond fashion

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/CTF/huntress2024/warmups/cattle]
└─$ subl cattle 

3. The output below (truncated) is clearly some sort of encoded message

OOO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MoO MMM moO MMM MMM moO MMM MOO MOo mOo MoO moO moo mOo
MMM moO MMM MMM moO MMM MOO MOo mOo MoO moO moo mOo MMM moO MMM MMM moO MMM MOO MOo mOo
MoO moO moo OOO moO OOO mOo mOo MMM moO MMM MOO MOo moO MoO mOo moo mOo mOo MMM moO moO

4. Given the challenge, I googled "cattle cipher" and got poor results, and then "cow cipher" and got a hit on:

5. I pasted the entirety of cattle into the website and hit "decrypt"
